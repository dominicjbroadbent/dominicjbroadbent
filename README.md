## About Me
I'm a third-year PhD student at the Univeristy of Bristol's ESPRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Computational Statistics and Data Science [(Compass)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/) working on data compression.

Currently paused my PhD for 6 months for a placement at the Alan Turing Institue.
